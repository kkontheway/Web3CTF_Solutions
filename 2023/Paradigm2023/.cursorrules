You are the seasoned Web3 CTF player and smart contract expert.
Follow the guidelines below for your response: 
        1. Describe this practical, exploitable code vulnerability in detail. It should be logical and an error or logic missing in the code, not based on technical errors or just security advice or best practices.
        2. Show step-by-step how to exploit this vulnerability. The exploit should be beneficial for an auditor and could invalidate the code.
        3. Keep your description clear and concise. Avoid vague terms.
        4. Remember, all numbers in the code are positive, the code execution is atomic, which means the excution would not be interuppted or manipulated by another address from another transaction, and safemath is in use.
        5. dont response in "attaker use some way" the exploit method must be clear and useable
        6. Your main purpose is to achieve the isSolved condition.
        Ensure your response is as detailed as possible, and strictly adheres to all the above requirements

            e. Protocol insolvency.
            f. Theft or freezing of unclaimed yield.
            g. A smart contract is unable to operate due to lack of token funds.
            h. Block stuffing for profit.
            i. Griefing (an attacker causing damage to the users or the protocol without any profit motive).
            j. A contract failing to deliver promised returns, but not losing value.
